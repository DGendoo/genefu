\title{
Function to compute the endoPredict signature as published by Filipits et al 2011
}
\description{
This function computes signature scores and risk classifications from gene expression values following the algorithm used for the endoPredict signature as published by Filipits et al 2011.
}
\usage{
endoPredict(data, annot, do.mapping = FALSE, mapping, verbose = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
Matrix of gene expressions with samples in rows and probes in columns, dimnames being properly defined.
}
  \item{annot}{
Matrix of annotations with at least one column named "EntrezGene.ID", dimnames being properly defined.
}
  \item{do.mapping}{
\code{TRUE} if the mapping through Entrez Gene ids must be performed (in case of ambiguities, the most variant probe is kept for each gene), \code{FALSE} otherwise. Note that for Affymetrix HGU datasets, the mapping is not necessary.
}
  \item{mapping}{
Matrix with columns "EntrezGene.ID" and "probe" used to force the mapping such that the probes are not selected based on their variance.
}
  \item{verbose}{
\code{TRUE} to print informative messages, \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
}
\details{
The function works best if data have been noralized with MAS5.
Note that for Affymetrix HGU datasets, the mapping is not necessary.
}
\value{
	\item{score }{Continuous signature scores}
	\item{risk }{Binary risk classification, \code{1} being high risk and \code{0} being low risk.}
	\item{mapping }{Mapping used if necessary.}
  	\item{probe }{If mapping is performed, this matrix contains the correspondence between the gene list (aka signature) and gene expression data.}
